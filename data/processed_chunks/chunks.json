INTRODUCTION NREN requirements for development of seamless nomadic networks necessitates that NREN staff have a working knowledge of basic satellite technology. This paper applications, technology trends, orbits, and spectrum, and hopefully will afford the reader an end-to-end picture of this important technology. Satellites are objects in orbits about the Earth. An orbit is a trajectory able to maintain gravitational equilibrium to circle the Earth without power assist. Physical laws that were comeptualized by Newton and Kepler govern orbital mechanics. The first satellite was the Moon, of course, but the idea of communications satellites came from Sir Arthur C.

The first communications satellite (a simple reflector) was the US. Echo I in 1960. The first “geosynchronous” (explained later) satellite, Syncom, went up in 1962. There are now over 5000 operational satellites in orbit, 232 of which are large commercial (mostly communications) satellites. Satellites have become essential for modern life. Among the important applications of satellite technology are video, voice, IP data, radio, Earth and space observation, global resource monitoring, military, positioning (GPS), micro-gravity science and many others.

They are subject to a higher error rate than fiber, and they are complex from both a physical and regulatory point of view.

Users rely upon these data for conducting historical stud ies of land surface change but have shouldered the burden of post - production processing to create appl ications -ready datasets. To alleviate this burden on the user , the USGS has initiated an effort to produce a collection of Landsat Level 2 Science Products (L2SP) to support land surface change studies .

ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset (GED) is a global, 100-meter spatial resolution emissivity map of the Earth’s non- frozen land surfaces at different wavelengths in the thermal infrared spectrum. ASTER GED emissivity and emissivity standard d eviations for Bands 13, 14, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are used in the surface temperature algorithm for Landsat 4- 9 data. ASTER Emissivity data are available to download from EarthExplorer. (https://doi.org/10.5066/P9ZQJ30Q )",

Landsat’s ongoing record of data focuses on medium -resolution remote sensing of Earth’s land surfaces. The goal of Landsat is to continue the collection, archive, and distribution of multispectral imagery affording global, synoptic, and repetitive coverage of land surfaces at a scale where natural and human -induced changes can be detected, differentiated, characterized, and monitored over time. The mission’s programmatic goals are stated in the United States Code, Title 15 Chapter 82 “Land Remote Sensing ",

    "text": "s programmatic goals are stated in the United States Code, Title 15 Chapter 82 “Land Remote Sensing Policy” (derived from the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992). This policy requires the Landsat program to provide data into the future that are sufficiently consistent with previous Landsat data, allowing the detection and quantitative characterization of changes in or on the Earth’s surface. The highly successful Landsat series of missions has provided satellite coverage since 1972. The data from these missions constitute the longest continuous record of Earth’s surface as seen from space. 1.2 Purpose and Scope This Data Format Control Book (DFCB) provides a high- level description of the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 Collection 2 ( C2) Level 2 ( L2) product distribution.
